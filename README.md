mozilla-get-url
===============

Find the url where a given mozilla product lives for all kinds of branches / releases / pre-releases.

Inspired by (firefox-get)[https://github.com/jsantell/node-firefox-get] which I initially contributed to for the
b2g-support... The primary difference is mozilla-get-url is designed to handle most mozilla products up front and
uses ftp rather then html scraping.
